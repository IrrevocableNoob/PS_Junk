<#The location of all of your cabs. If using PSADT, just set #FoD_Source = $dirFiles and put all cabs in the "Files" folder of your PSADT source folder and the "metadata" folder beneath that. Final structure would be:

#Alternatively if you want something specific like just ADUC, comment out line 4 and use this var instead:
#$RSAT_FoD = Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory* -Online -Source $dirFiles

#Install RSAT Tools
